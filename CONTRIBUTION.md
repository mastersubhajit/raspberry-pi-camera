# New Contributor Guide

* Please create a fork where you can make your changes and create a pull request for a review in order to improve this project further.
* If you spot a problem with the docs, search if an issue already exists. If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant issue form. Don't ask silly question rather search it on Google.
* Scan through our existing issues to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using labels as filters. See Labels for more information. As a general rule, we don’t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.
